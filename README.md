# wolf3d-mockup
A quick mockup of a Wolf3d-renderer in C.

Just a quick mockup for a Wolfenstein3d renderer using SDL2 for an upcomming Gamejam.

## Build

Run `make`, executable will be in build/.

## Installation

Run `git clone` on this repo.
Make sure you have SDL2 installed in a way such that gcc can link it.


Not much more to it, this is really just a test.
